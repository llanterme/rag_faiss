# Introduction to Vector Databases

Vector databases have become essential components in modern AI applications, particularly those involving natural language processing and semantic search.

## What are Vector Databases?

Vector databases store and index data as high-dimensional vectors, making them optimized for similarity search operations. When you convert text, images, or other data into vector representations (embeddings), a vector database allows you to efficiently find similar items.

## FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

FAISS is an open-source library developed by Facebook Research for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It's particularly useful for applications that require:

1. Nearest neighbor search in high dimensions
2. Efficient handling of large datasets
3. Fast retrieval times with minimal memory overhead

## Applications

Vector databases like FAISS enable many modern AI features:

- Semantic search
- Recommendation systems
- Image recognition
- Duplicate detection
- Document similarity
- Question answering systems

## Integration with LLMs

By combining vector databases with Large Language Models (LLMs), you can create powerful retrieval-augmented generation systems that can access and leverage large amounts of specialized knowledge.
