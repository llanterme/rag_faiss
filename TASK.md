## Completed Tasks

### 2025-06-14
- Implemented embedding model alignment and config-driven selection:
  - Updated config.py to separate LLM and embedding configuration
  - Added metadata storage for embedding model information
  - Implemented validation to prevent mismatched embedding models
  - Updated CLI to use config-driven approach instead of command-line parameters
  - Improved error messages with clear guidance on fixing embedding mismatches
  - Updated README.md with documentation on the new config-driven approach
  - Ensured backward compatibility with existing indexes
- Migrated Ollama integration to use the official langchain-ollama package:
  - Added langchain-ollama v0.3.3 dependency to pyproject.toml
  - Updated imports in embeddings.py to use OllamaEmbeddings from langchain_ollama
  - Updated imports in langgraph_chain.py to use ChatOllama from langchain_ollama
  - Removed deprecation warnings by using the official package
  - Updated documentation in README.md to reflect the changes
  - Maintained backward compatibility with existing workflows

- Added Ollama as a pluggable LLM backend:
  - Added langchain-community dependency to pyproject.toml
  - Updated config.py to add LLM provider selection and Ollama configuration
  - Modified embeddings.py to support both OpenAI and Ollama embeddings
  - Updated langgraph_chain.py to support both OpenAI and Ollama LLMs
  - Enhanced CLI with provider selection and display options
  - Updated README.md with usage examples for both providers
  - Ensured backward compatibility with existing OpenAI workflows

### 2025-06-12
- Created TASK.md file for progress tracking

- Created project directory structure
- Implemented skeleton modules with proper type hints and docstrings:
  - src/config.py: Pydantic Settings class for environment variables
  - src/ingestion.py: Functions for loading TXT, PDF, and DOCX files
  - src/embeddings.py: Functions for creating, saving, and loading FAISS index
  - src/qa_chain.py: Function for building retrieval QA chain with GPT-4o model
  - src/cli.py: Typer app with commands for ingest, chat, history, and exit
- Formatted code with Black
- Updated TASK.md with progress
